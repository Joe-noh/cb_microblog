This is a [Chicago Boss](http://www.chicagoboss.org "Chicago Boss") example project.

## My Env

My dev env is

* Mac OSX 10.8.4
* Erlang R16B (erts-5.10.1)
* ChicagoBoss 0.8.7

## DB

This project uses in-memory datebase (mock).
You can try quickly.

## Caution

This application uses MD5 to encrypt passwords.
But this is dangerous. Please do NOT imitate this in production env.
I recommend bcrypt or scrypt.

## TODO

Test! Test! More Test!
